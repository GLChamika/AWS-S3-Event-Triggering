This will hosts a simple yet powerful project that demonstrates the utilization of AWS S3 event triggering. AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a widely-used object storage service, and this project showcases how to harness its event notification capabilities to create responsive and automated workflows.


Here are some examples of top companies that use S3 event triggering:

**Netflix**: Netflix use S3 event triggering to automatically process video files uploaded to Amazon S3, enabling seamless content ingestion and processing.

**Airbnb**: This lodging and homestays aggregator use S3 event triggering to automatically process and analyze data stored in Amazon S3, such as guest reviews and booking information.

**Expedia**: They use S3 event triggering to automatically process and analyze data stored in Amazon S3, such as travel bookings, user profiles, and pricing information, to power their personalized travel recommendations and search features.
